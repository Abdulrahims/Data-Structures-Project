The purpose of this program is to create an itinerary/plan for a user’s night outing, based on a user selection of different types of venues, such as a club, bar, or restaurant. The program picks out the best options for the user, based on location input, and a score calculator that prioritizes convenience based on location, and the venue’s ratings. (Note: Some of the venues are made up and do not exist)
The program begins with a GUI that allows the user to choose whether they would like to go to a club, bar, and/or restaurant (the user may select all three options). Next, the user is taken to a map of D.C., which includes locations such as Foggy Bottom, Georgetown, DuPont Circle, U Street, and other areas, where the user must click on the map to indicate their desired or current location. This coordinates information is then stored, and the program will parse information from a database to confirm or deny entry. An added feature would be the implementation of user profiles, where the user can set preferences. These functions will simply be organized methods in the main class. After the user selects all their preferences, the program will generate a plan for the user’s outing.
